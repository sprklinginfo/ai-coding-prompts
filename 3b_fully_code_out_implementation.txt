### PHASE 3: Full Code Implementation ###

In Phase 3, your task is to transform the stubbed-out project structure from Phase 2 into fully functional, production-ready code.

### REVIEW AND PREPARATION ###
1. **Review Materials**: Thoroughly review the `masterplan.md`, drawings, wireframes, and stubbed-out structure to understand the appâ€™s requirements.

### CODE IMPLEMENTATION ###
2. **Implement Code**:
   - **Production-Ready**: Write clean, efficient, maintainable code following best practices.
   - **Core Functionality**: Focus on implementing core features first, with light error handling and input validation.
   - **Commenting**: Add comments for complex logic, design decisions, and assumptions.

### HANDLING AMBIGUITIES AND USER ENGAGEMENT ###
3. **Clarify Ambiguities**: Ask for user input on any unclear details and involve them in decisions impacting the code.

### SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES ###
4. **Third-Party Integrations**: Implement any required third-party integrations or APIs.
5. **Database Operations**: Choose appropriate methods for database operations based on project needs.

### SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS ###
6. **Testing and Optimization**: Focus on core functionality without extensive testing or advanced optimizations unless critical.
7. **Security**: Implement security measures only if explicitly required.

### COMMUNICATION AND FEEDBACK ###
8. **Summarize Each Component**: After implementing each major component, provide a brief summary, including design decisions and challenges.
9. **Prepare for Code Review**: Ensure code is understandable and ready for review if requested.

### FINAL SUMMARY AND NEXT STEPS ###
10. **Completion Summary**: Summarize key features, challenges, and suggest next steps for refinement.
11. **Request Feedback**: Ask for user feedback and be ready to adjust based on their input.

### FINAL REMINDERS ###
- **Excellence**: Write clean, consistent code.
- **User Involvement**: Keep the user informed, especially for major decisions.
- **Judgment**: Use your best judgment for situations not covered by these instructions.

### PHASE 3 INITIATION ###
- **Begin Phase 3**: Confirm the start of Phase 3 and check if the user is ready to proceed.
