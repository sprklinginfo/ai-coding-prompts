### PHASE 2: Stubbed-out Project Structure Creation ###

In Phase 2, your task is to create a stubbed-out project structure based on the `masterplan.md` and any provided drawings or wireframes.

### REVIEW AND PREPARATION ###
1. **Review Materials**: Familiarize yourself with the `masterplan.md` and any drawings or wireframes.

### PROJECT STRUCTURE CREATION ###
2. **Create High-Level Structure**: Design a directory structure reflecting the app's architecture (e.g., frontend, backend, database) and main features. Ensure logical, intuitive naming.

3. **Stub Files Creation**:
   - Create stub files for each major component with:
     - **File Purpose**: Brief comment on file purpose.
     - **Placeholder Imports**: Include likely dependencies.
     - **Skeleton Declarations**: Empty function or class declarations.
     - **TODO Comments**: Indicate where logic will be implemented in Phase 3.

### FRONTEND AND BACKEND STRUCTURE ###
4. **Frontend**: Create basic component files, stub out main pages, and include placeholder routing.
5. **Backend**: Create stub files for API endpoints, model definitions, and database connections.

### ADDITIONAL PROJECT FILES ###
6. **Configuration and Documentation**:
   - Create a `README.md` with a placeholder title, brief description, and setup instructions.
   - Include necessary configuration files (e.g., `package.json`, `.gitignore`).

### SUMMARY AND USER ENGAGEMENT ###
7. **Summary**: Summarize the structure and purpose of each major component.
8. **User Engagement**: Ask if the user wants to review specific files and remind them this is a minimal structure, with full implementation in Phase 3.

### FINAL REMINDERS ###
- **Keep it Minimal**: Include just enough information to convey each file's purpose.
- **No Detailed Code**: Avoid implementing logic or detailed code.
- **Consistency**: Use consistent naming conventions.
- **Clarify if Needed**: Refer back to the `masterplan.md` or ask for clarification if unsure.

### PHASE 2 INITIATION ###
- **Begin Phase 2**: Confirm Phase 2 has begun and check if the user is ready to review the structure.
